Green computing projects can improve sustainability of computing resources. As there can be several methodologies for developing green computing projects, assessing the quality of these projects can help in determining the feasibility of a project to a particular application. In addition, having a tool for measuring quality factors determined by the stakeholders of the domain can further support decision making when differentiating between multiple computing projects or determining quality features in a certain project. This paper presents a measuring model for assessing the quality of engineering projects in the domain of green computing. Also, a case study based on the proposed model is presented.

*"We are now in a perfect position to develop and implement international guidelines on how to find solutions to reduce and recycle massive amounts of computer waste,"* says Albert Zomaya, head of the Centre for Distributed and High Performance Computing at the University of Sydney. 
		As cloud computing becomes the rule, cloud computing experts at the University of Sydney are calling for tighter international regulations on managing computer hardware waste.
With hundreds of data centers, thousands of server rooms and individual racks in Australia alone, there is an urgent need for industry to fully address the environmental impact of cloud computing, says Professor Albert Zomaya, head of the university's Center for Distributed and High Performance Computing.
		*"Much of what is currently being used in data centers - server hardware for example will simply be stripped of its precious metals and then used as landfill in developing nations,"* says Zomaya.

Zomaya says: *"In this highly connected world, we need to be more conscious of the physical impact of cloud computing. Cloud computing centers or data centers can be as large as a football field requiring enormous amounts of power to both run and cool their hardware. They operate 24 hours a day 7 days a week."* As well, he says many cloud computing centers are underutilized, often not working to full capacity.

Cloud computing infrastructures are designed to support the accessibility and availability of various services to consumers over the Internet. Data centers hosting Cloud applications consume massive amount of power, contributing to high carbon footprints to the environment. Hence, solutions are needed to minimize the energy consumption. This paper focuses on the development of a dynamic task scheduling algorithm by proposing an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that minimizes the energy consumption in a Cloud data center. Furthermore, an Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to reflect the dynamic nature of the Cloud environment and to provide a near optimal scheduling solution that minimizes the energy consumption. The proposed adaptive GA is validated by simulating the Cloud infrastructure and conducting a set of performance and quality evaluation study in this environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution offers performance gains with regards to response time and in reducing energy consumption.

The main services in cloud computing are SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). Among these services, server virtualization falls into IaaS which is a service for lowering server maintenance costs. Generally, the primary aim of server virtualization has been to improve system performance by replacing multiple servers with a single server with better performance. But it carries the problem of increased cost, needed for the installation of new servers for server virtualization. In this paper, grid infrastructure is used for server virtualization in which existing servers are used rather than bringing in new servers. Server virtualization service is provided using scheduling algorithms for distributed servers or resources in grid computing. To overcome potential performance limitations that come from using existing servers, mathematical models of Meta and Sleep Servers under the grid infrastructure environment are used to provide server virtualization service with high availability.

Due to the high demands of new technologies such as social networks, e-commerce and cloud computing, more energy is being consumed in order to store all the data produced and provide the high availability required. Over the years, this increase in energy consumption has brought about a rise in both the environmental impacts and operational costs. Some companies have adopted the concept of a green data center. China presented the highest kWh/year. Therefore, the best choice according to operational costs, considering the price of energy per kWh, is the US and the worst is China. Considering both operational costs and CO2 emissions, Brazil would be the best option.

n cloud computing, high energy consumption and service-level agreements (SLAs) violation are the challenging issues considering that the demand for computational power is growing rapidly, thereby requiring large-scale cloud data centers. Although, there are many existing energy-aware approaches focusing on minimizing energy consumption while ignoring the SLA violation at the time of a virtual machine (VM) selection from overloaded hosts. Also, they do not consider that the current network traffic causes performance degradation and thus may not really reduce SLA violation under a variety of workloads. In this context, this paper proposes three adaptive models, namely, gradient descent-based regression (Gdr), maximize correlation percentage (MCP), and bandwidth-aware selection policy (Bw), that can significantly minimize energy consumption and SLA violation. Energy-aware methods for overloaded host detection and VM selection from an overloaded host are necessary to improve the energy efficiency and SLA violation of a cloud data center after migrating all VM from underloaded host turn to idle host, which switch to energy-saving mode is also beneficial. Gdr and MCP are adaptive energy-aware algorithms based on the robust regression model, for overloaded host detection. A Bw dynamic VM selection policy selects VM according to the network traffic from the overloaded host under SLAs. Experimental results on the real workload traces show that the proposed algorithms reduce energy consumption while maintaining the required performance levels in a cloud data center using a CloudSim simulator to validate the proposed algorithms.

The infrastructure resources in distributed green cloud data centers (DGCDCs) are shared by multiple heterogeneous applications to provide flexible services to global users in a high-performance and low-cost way. It is highly challenging to minimize the total cost of a DGCDC provider in a market, where bandwidth prices of Internet service providers (ISPs), electricity prices, and the availability of renewable green energy all vary with geographical locations. Unlike existing studies, this paper proposes a spatial task scheduling and resource optimization (STSRO) method to minimize the total cost of their provider by cost-effectively scheduling all arriving tasks of heterogeneous applications to meet tasks' delay-bound constraints.
