# Top Super Powers in computing.

{{< hint info >}}

This section will highlight the most powerful nations in computing. All these visualizations were done in the Wolfram Language. The visualizations hope to achieve a visual comprehension of the issue.

This image demonstrates the heat dissipation created by a CPU. A CPU is responsible for carrying out all computations and therefore creates heat. We can see in this picture the heat produced covers almost the entire board. Imagine this on larger scale with extremely powerful computers.
