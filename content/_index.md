# Ecological Improvements In Computations

{{< columns >}}
## Environmental Concerns

Data centers are responsible for contributing to green house emissions and being anti-ecological. Problems arise in the huge amount of energy required by these data centers is ultimately wasted.

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is responsible for the rise in many streaming services. Better quality of phone calls, video conference, and social media websites.

## Purpose 

Demonstrate the harm that large scale data centers can have on the environment. As cloud computing rises in popularity the issue will become more obvious. Therefore, measures must be employed in the field of computation to not cause irreversible damage to the environment. These change can already be seen in major companies, this is known as **green computing**. TThis website will offer an overview and comprehenive take on how an ecological problem is being improved.

### Google Sun and Data Centers 

This is an example of green computing being employed in one of the most recognized company in the world. This is very [exiciting!](https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows?fbclid=IwAR1U9nijT5b1dvBYU_jVQ6cBkoECpUvY2rXva2ejxKlLjeVeZX_LjRl22dg)

# Opinion Piece

{{< hint info >}}
It has been my research that the main problem in computing regarding environmental concerns is energy consumption. It is common knowledge in the IT sector, that data centers are enormous warehouses housing the computers responsible for our favorite streaming services, social media websites, and gaming platforms. These warehouse exhort enormous amounts of heat and also require large amounts of energy to maintain. This large energy consumption and heat exhaustion has been found to be detrimental to the environment. 
	However, the professional consensus in that their should be specialized unit of measures to quantify a data-centers energy consumption. Their are also special constraints that can be employed  that help reduce environmental impact. This is known as green computing, and is specialized knowledge in how to build data-centers with ecological concerns. Modernization in electrical components are also proceeding to be announced as definite solutions to ecological concerns regarding computing. Such as, building “energy-aware” electrical components that can be placed in regular computer hardware and will;l be responsive to the energy that required at the time. These electrical components although very impressive, are not mass produced and are still in experimental phases. The ....
